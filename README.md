# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection

**Brain Tumor Detection** is an AI-powered application that classifies MRI brain scans into four categories:  
- Glioma  
- Meningioma  
- Pituitary Adenoma  
- No Tumor  

The system leverages **deep learning models** such as **Xception**, **ResNet**, **Custom CNN**, and **EfficientNetB4** to deliver accurate and reliable predictions. It is designed for **educational and research purposes** to showcase the power of AI in medical imaging.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Upload an MRI scan and get instant classification results.  
- **Multiple Model Support**: Choose between pre-trained models (Xception, ResNet, CNN, EfficientNetB4).  
- **Explainability**: Display model metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Interactive UI**: Clean, responsive interface with light/dark mode support.  
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Easily upload MRI scans for quick analysis.  
- **Sample Dataset Testing**: Try out preloaded MRI scans without needing your own dataset.
