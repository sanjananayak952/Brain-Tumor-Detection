# Brain Tumor Detection

<img src="screenshots/logo.png" width="300"/>  
<strong>Brain Tumor Detection</strong> is an AI-powered web application designed to classify MRI images into tumor categories such as **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **No Tumor**, and **Pituitary Adenoma**. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models like **Xception**, **Custom CNN**, and **EfficientNetB4** to provide accurate predictions with detailed model metadata.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Prediction**: Upload an MRI image and get instant predictions.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from multiple pre-trained models (e.g., Xception, Custom CNN, EfficientNetB4).
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes for better accessibility.
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Easily upload images via drag-and-drop or file selection.
- **Explainable Metadata**: View detailed model information, including accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Sample Images**: Test the system with preloaded MRI images for quick exploration.
